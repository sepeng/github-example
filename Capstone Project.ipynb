    "London is one of the most popular study destinations and has been ranked the 1st for Best Student Cities. It is also a popular destination for international students looking for higher education experiences. According to the Evening Standard, there are more than 120,000 international students in London in the year of 2018/19. Except for the expensive rent in London, many students are also concerned about the safety of the areas for living.\n",

    "This project is going to review the boroughs in London based on total crimes numbers and types of each area, top venues in the borough will also be explored. In addition, the neighbourhoods will be clustered using k-means clustering. The results can be a reference for International students planning to find a safe and cosy home in London."

However, this result only takes in consideration of total crimes occured in that area without looking into the types of the crimes and the population of the area and therefore the results may not be strictly accurate. For example, the crimes of theft and burglary happens more frequently in the areas popular with tourists, such as Westminter, where many major tourist attractions are located, whereas the violence related crimes can be a major concern for international students when finding a home in a specific area.\n",
